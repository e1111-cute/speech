# Who am I? 

## 1
2o years ago, on a garden bench sitting a little girl who was wondering what she will be when she grows up. 

Will she be a movie star? 
Or be a popular singer? 
Or be a professional dancer 
Or just be someone’s wife who takes care of her husband and children. … 
I suppose, there is no student who loves study will have such dreams.

Yes, that girl she hated study so much! She hang out with her friends every study day and every weekend. 

She talked loudly in class and never listened to her teachers carefully. 
All her homework were copied from other students. 
It was lucky for her to pass her first and second grade in the primary school. 
But unfortunately she failed her third grade’s final exam. 
Her head teacher called her father to have a face to face meeting. 
She was panic and freaked out because although she wasn’t the only girl who failed the exam but she was the only girl whom asked by the teacher to talk with her parents. 
When her father came, she even didn’t dare to look at his eyes. 
She thought her father would be mad enough to give her a hard punishment. 
But her father didn’t say any word to her after talking to her teacher. 
It’s was a long way home even though she walked that road everyday and in fact it’s only 1 km far away from her school.

Before went to bed that night, her father finally talked to her, 

he said


>  I know you will be my special girl from the first sight of your birth. 
>
>  You have magic, a magic to turn you into a better person. 
>
>  You can do anything as long as you want to do”. 


She felt so guilty and cried out. 
After that day, she studied hard and became the best student in her class in half years time. 
She went into high school and college successfully and never made her parents worry about her anymore. 
She truly believes that she kind of have a magic to make herself a better person and can achieve any goals in her life.

5 years ago, 
there was a young lady sitting at a chair in a Subway station wondering whether should she leave Nanjing, a city broke her heart deeply. 

She was so confused. Her parents live there, her friends live there, her job is there, her life circle is there. 

Would it be too pity to leave so many people just because of some bad memories? 
And what If she can’t find a satisfied job after she left Nanjing? 
What If she can’t make friends in the new city which she is going to live? 
Her life is full of uncertainty. 
But suddenly her father’s words rushed into her mind 


> You have a magic, 
> a magic that can help you do anything you want to do.


So she quit her job in Nanjing and headed for the new city. 

She got a job there and worked as hard as she always did. 
In her spare time, She learned cooking, dancing and now she joined an amazing club to learn English. 

Previously she was shy to speak in public but now she is standing on the stage telling her stories.
